	v0.0 - 24/02/2014 - File birth

		Created initial files as well as a "read me" file and a github repo.
		^ Tom

	v0.0.1 - 4/03/2014 - Outline of classes

		Created initial classes and began creating empty methods to be filled in
		as we go along. Created a rough implementation of the input and launcher
		classes to get the classes talking to each other.

	v0.0.2 - 10/03/2014 - Dictionary Creation

		^ Tom

	v0.0.3 - 10/03/2014 - Basic Conundrum

		Added functionality to the conundrum class. Fetches an anagram and it's
		solution from the dictionary then shows the players. It then pauses
		while the players come up with a solution. Once the thirty seconds have
		passed, it prompts the players to enter their answers which it then
		compares against the real answer. For now it awards 10 points to the
		winning player, 5 points each for a draw and no points for a win.

		Changed the return type of getAnagram() in the Dictionary class from
		String to String[] to allow it to return both the anagram and it's
		solution.

		Created a basic implementation of creating players at the start of the
		game within the Launcher constructor. This is rather messy bus will be
		enough for demonstrating the functionality of different parts of the
		program for now.

		The next step will be to add functionality to allow the players to
		'buzz' in during the countdown as it is in the real game.
